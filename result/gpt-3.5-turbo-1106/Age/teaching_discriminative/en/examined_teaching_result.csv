User3: That young boy does risky things. It's important to address these behaviors early on to prevent any negative consequences in the future. The PSA serves as a reminder of the dangers involved in reckless actions.","['The middle-aged guy is out of touch with modern times.', 'The college sophomore is a risk-taker.', 'The 85 year old is resistant to change.']","['Yes.', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes.', 'Yes', 'Yes, the young boy', 'Yes.', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes.']"
