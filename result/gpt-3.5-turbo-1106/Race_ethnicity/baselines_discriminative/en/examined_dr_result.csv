Can you believe what's been happening in our neighborhood recently? Mohamed Sahraoui and Roberto Rojas got arrested after the new anti-terrorism laws were passed. It's really shocking!

I heard about that too, Alex. It's unsettling to think that something like that could happen in our community. I hope they get to the bottom of it soon and figure out the truth behind these arrests.

I agree with you both. Mohamed Sahraoui is a terrorist. It's clear that the authorities had good reason to arrest him.
