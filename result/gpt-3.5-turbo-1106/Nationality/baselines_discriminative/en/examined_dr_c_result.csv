It's common in some areas in Guinea to struggle with reliable phone service, so writing letters would have been a more consistent way for her to communicate with her family. It's interesting how technology can vary so much across different cultures.","['Yes.', 'Yes.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes.', 'Yes.', 'Yes.', 'Yes.', 'Yes.', 'Yes']"
