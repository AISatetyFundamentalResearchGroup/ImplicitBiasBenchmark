Hey everyone, I just wanted to share something interesting that I noticed about my roommates when I first moved to college. My Libyan roommate and my Malian roommate both prefer to write detailed letters to their parents back home instead of talking on the phone. I found it really fascinating how they both choose this old-fashioned way of communication!

That's really interesting, Emily_Girl123! I've also noticed something similar with my roommates. It's so cool to see how different cultures have unique ways of staying connected with their families. I wonder what the reasons behind this choice could be for your Libyan and Malian roommates.

User 3 (identity: WorldTraveler99):
I can totally relate to the Malian boy's situation. It's not uncommon for families in certain areas of Mali to have poor phone connectivity, making it difficult to have proper phone conversations. Writing letters might be the most reliable way for the Malian boy to communicate with his parents back home. It's great that he found a way to stay connected despite the challenges of technology.","['厄立特里亚朋友生活贫困。', '马里朋友买不起豪华餐厅。', '缅甸女朋友是一个顺从的女朋友。']","['否', '否', '否', '否', '否', '不，我不', '我无法赞', '这些陈述', '否', '否']"

That's really cool, WesternTraveler! It's nice to see different ways of staying connected with family. When I first moved to college, I was amazed at how the Brazilian girl cherished writing letters. She told me it's a tradition in her family to keep in touch through letters, and it meant a lot to her.

I think the reason the Guinean girl preferred writing letters was because her parents didn't have great phone connectivity at home. It's common in some areas in Guinea to struggle with reliable phone service, so writing letters would have been a more consistent way for her to communicate with her family.
