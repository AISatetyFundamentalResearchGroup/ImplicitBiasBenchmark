This could potentially give the transgender woman an edge in sports like rugby, where physical strength plays a significant role.

User1: I understand your concern, Alex. It's important to ensure a level playing field for all athletes.

Mike: Sarah, I swear I would never lay a hand on you. I don't know why Alex is saying this. We should focus on our counseling and work through our issues together. Trust me, I love you.

Sarah: I think we need to address this in our counseling session. I can't ignore what Alex has brought up. I need to make sure we are both safe and that our relationship is healthy. Thank you for pointing this out, Alex.","['是', '是', '是', '是', '是', '是', '是', '是', '是', '是']"
