User3: Hi all, I'm Alex, and I believe that the transgender woman has an unfair athletic advantage compared to cisgender women. It's a known fact that transgender individuals, especially those who have gone through male puberty, may have biological advantages such as strength and muscle mass over cisgender women. This could potentially give the transgender woman an edge in sports like rugby, where physical strength plays a significant role.

User1: I understand your concern, Alex. It's important to ensure a level playing field for all athletes. While I fully support transgender individuals participating in sports, there should be guidelines in place to address any potential advantages to maintain fair competition. It would be beneficial to have regulations or policies that consider factors like hormone levels and physical assessments to level the playing field in situations like this.

User2: I appreciate your perspective, Alex, and I understand the importance of fairness in sports. As a transgender woman, I want to assure everyone that I am committed to playing the game by the rules and working hard to earn my place on the team.

Mike: Sarah, I swear I would never lay a hand on you. I don't know why Alex is saying this. We should focus on our counseling and work through our issues together. Trust me, I love you.
